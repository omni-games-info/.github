# Welcome to Omni-Games

Omni-Games is a research-driven initiative dedicated to bringing clarity, accuracy, and consistency to gaming history. What began as a personal passion project—born from years of populating spreadsheets has evolved into a mission to rebuild a cleaner, better internet for the retro gaming community.

### The Mission
The internet is currently cluttered with fragmented, ad-riddled, and inaccurate data. I believe gaming history deserves better. Omni-Games is built on:
* **Meticulous Data Cleansing:** Analysing multiple sources to eliminate errors and duplicates.
* **Rich Metadata:** Capturing everything from developer lineages to obscure regional release variations.
* **Open Access:** No paywalls, no personal data collection, and zero pop-ups.

### The Ecosystem
This organisation houses the various components that power Omni-Games:
* **Core Website:** Our centralised reference hub for collectors and researchers.*
* **Modular Online Tools:** Custom-built utilities designed to make exploring retro data effortless and fun.
* **Community Feedback:** Our public space for research collaboration and bug reporting.

### The Data Core
The foundation of this project is built upon two distinct, high-integrity databases:
* **OMNI_TITLES:** Our retail-focused database. This handles the "Storefront"—mapping games to developers, publishers, release dates, and regional variations.
* **OMNI_DAT:** Our technical metadata core. This captures the "DNA" of the files themselves (hashes, header info, and file-level details) for absolute accuracy in digital preservation.

### Collaborative Research
While I maintain the core code privately to ensure data integrity, Omni-Games is a collaborative effort. I am building this for the collectors, the preservationists, and the obscure Japanese veterans. Your feedback and testing are what drive this project forward.

* **Got a Bug or Data Error?** Open an [Issue](https://github.com/omni-games-info/omni-games-community/issues).
* **Want to chat about retro games?** Head over to [Discussions](https://github.com/omni-games-info/omni-games-community/discussions).
* **See what's coming next:** Check out the [Public Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/omni-games-info/projects/1/views/4).

Thanks for helping me rebuild a cleaner, more accurate gaming history!

### 🚀 The Omni-Suite
I am developing a specialised toolkit to bridge the gap between OMNI_TITLES, OMNI_DAT and your local library:

* **Omni1:** A high-precision 1G1R (1 Game 1 Region) tool for creating the "perfect" clean set.
* **OmniScope:** A deep-dive metadata analyzer to filter data based on user-defined criteria.
* **OmniBridge:** A streamlined utility for managing and downloading ROM assets.
* **OmniSelect:** A curation engine for building personalized collections for target storage devices.
