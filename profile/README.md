# Welcome to Omni-Games

Omni-Games is a research-driven initiative dedicated to bringing clarity, accuracy, and consistency to gaming history. What began as a personal passion project—born from years of populating spreadsheets has evolved into a mission to rebuild a cleaner, better internet for the retro gaming community.

The Mission
The internet is currently cluttered with fragmented, ad-riddled, and inaccurate data. I believe gaming history deserves better. Omni-Games is built on:
* **Meticulous Data Cleansing:** Analysing multiple sources to eliminate errors and duplicates.
* **Rich Metadata:** Capturing everything from developer lineages to obscure regional release variations.
* **Open Access:** No paywalls, no personal data collection, and zero pop-ups.

The Ecosystem
This organisation houses the various components that power Omni-Games:
* **Core Website:** Our centralized reference hub for collectors and researchers.
* **Modular Tools:** Custom-built utilities designed to make exploring retro data effortless and fun.
* **Community Feedback:** Our public space for research collaboration and bug reporting.

Collaborative Research
While I maintain the core code privately to ensure data integrity, Omni-Games is a collaborative effort. I am building this for the collectors, the preservationists, and the obscure Japanese veterans. Your feedback and testing are what drive this project forward.
